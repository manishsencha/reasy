# Reasy

## What is reasy?
Reasy is a shell script created to make things easy in initializing a react app.

## Usage 
<ul>
  <li><code>./reasy.sh <react-app-name></code></li>
</ul>

If you get an error like permission denied, give it permission to execute. <br>

<code>chmod +x reasy.sh</code>

## What it does?
Reasy creates a React app, then deletes all the test files and source files and then rewrites its src directory with custom files. 
It also creates Components and Assets directory in src directory which I believe generally required in typical React app.

## Why reasy?
I always do the same thing repeatatively after creating a React app. I created the script so that I don't have to do the same thing, basically automating my task.

## What's next?
The script is good enough to use, Although it lacks a few things which I feel can be implemented. You can also contribute to this simple and easy project. 
Just ask yourself what are the things you always do after creating a React app.
